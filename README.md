### Framer Motion Overview

**What are the advantages?**  
Framer Motion offers a simple yet powerful API for creating animations in React applications. Its main benefits include smooth animations, a declarative approach, and compatibility with various frameworks.

**Next.js SSR compatible**  
Framer Motion is fully compatible with Next.js and its server-side rendering (SSR) capabilities. This ensures that animations are seamless and the user experience remains consistent when using both tools together.

**Getting Started with Framer Motion**  
For beginners, Framer Motion offers a straightforward setup process. Integrating it into React applications is hassle-free, and there's a plethora of tutorials available to assist with the initial setup.

**Layout Animation**  
One of the standout features of Framer Motion is its ability to automatically animate layout changes. This means developers don't need to manually adjust animations when the layout changes - Framer Motion handles it gracefully.

**Key Takeaways**  
- Simple API for intricate animations.
- Seamless integration with popular frameworks like Next.js.
- Automatic animations for layout changes.

**Shared Layout Animation**  
Framer Motion provides a feature known as shared layout animations. This allows for smooth transitions between different components, making UI changes less jarring and more visually appealing.

**Shared Layout Groups Animation**  
This extends the shared layout capability to groups of components. It's especially useful for animating lists or grids of items where individual elements might change position or content.

**<LayoutGroup /> component for Groups**  
The `<LayoutGroup />` component in Framer Motion helps in defining which components belong to a shared layout group. It assists in managing and optimizing animations for groups of elements.
